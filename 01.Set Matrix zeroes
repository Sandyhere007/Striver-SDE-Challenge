The task is to set the whole row and column elements to be zero where we finds a 0 as (i,j) array element.

brute 
1. traverse the whole matrix and marking the whole row and column with -9999 when we got a 0;
2. traverse again and make 0 at place of -9999
Time Compexity O(n*m) * O(n+m) + o(n*m)

Better
use extra arrays of size row and columns and making change in that arrays.
if we got a number 0 in row or column array make the whole row and column =0;

1.we will be using a col0 initially col0 =1 ; element to keep track of ever(i,0) element and set col0 as zero if element is 0
2.we will run a loop say i from 0 to n ; 
  where we update mat[i][0] and mat[0][j] as 0 if we encounters an array elements say index(i,j) as 0.
  now we start from bottom row and last index and change it to 0 zero if either of mat[i][0] or mat[0][j] is 0.
  The reason we are doing it like backtracking is that if we do it from front our unnecessary number will also get updated as zero if any of the row 0 element is 0.
  at last inside the running loop itself we check that if col0 = 0 update mat[i][0] = 0;



#include <bits/stdc++.h>

void setZeros(vector<vector<int>> &matrix)
{
	// Write your code here.
	int col0 = 1;
	for(int i = 0 ; i < matrix.size() ; i++){
		if(matrix[i][0]==0) col0 = 0;
		for(int j  = 1 ; j < matrix[0].size() ; j++){
			if(matrix[i][j]==0 ){
				matrix[i][0] = 0;
				matrix[0][j] = 0;
			}
		}
	}

	for(int i = matrix.size()-1 ; i>=0 ; i--){ //using i till 0 because we need to cover al rows
		for(int j = matrix[0].size()-1 ; j>=1 ; j--){ //using j till 1 because we have already set 0th element as zero we do not need to do that again
			if(matrix[i][0]==0 || matrix[0][j]==0){
				matrix[i][j] = 0;
			}
		}
		if(col0 == 0) matrix[i][0] = 0;
	}
